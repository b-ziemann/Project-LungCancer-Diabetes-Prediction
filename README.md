## Project-LungCancer-Diabetes-Prediction
Jupyter Notebook with R to make prediction if someone could have lung cancer or not. Second part of the project was predicting if someone has diabetes. I compared lasso/ridge regression vs Naive Bayes conditional probabilty. 

## Techniques:
1) Lasso/Ridge regression
2) Naive Bayes
